# srpk
> simple rust passkey

srpk is a locally-stored CLI **password management** tool that uses your clipboard.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

**This was a learning project for Rust, and might not be entirely secure!**
That said, to my knowledge, this should be OK:
- Uses AES256
- Password goes through a bcrypt hash, cost is configurable
But, if an issue is spotted, please indicate with an [issue](https://github.com/jack-avery/srpk/issues).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Usage

```
create or target srpk vault:
    init <vault>    create a new vault at directory <vault>
    use <vault>     set <vault> as active vault
    which           see which vault is currently active

work with the active vault:
    ls              see keys in vault
    mk <key>        create new password with name <key>
    rm <key>        remove existing password with name <key>
    <key>           get existing password with name <key>

srpk will clear your clipboard 10 seconds after use
```

Sample usage:
```
$ srpk init my_vault
(prompts password and creates vault)

$ srpk mk my_password
(prompts vault password then for new my_password)

$ srpk my_password
(prompts vault password then shunts my_password into clipboard;
    clears your clipboard after 10s)
```
